If you are new to Matlab, first read 
the <a href="Handouts/matlabPrimer35.pdf">Matlab primer</a> 
and try running the code described there.

We assume that all students will do all assignments on either CSLAB
(our research computer system) or CDF (the department teaching network).  
Graduate students in CS should already have a CSLAB account.  Other students
should use the CDF system.  If you do not have a CDF account and need one 
to complete the coursework, contact the instructor.
For information on CDF see 
<a href="http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/">http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/</a>.
Before going to a CDF lab you need to
<a href="http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/cgi-bin/webfinger">look-up your 
CDF account</a>.

<H3>CDF/CSLAB Information</H3>

<p>Check out this <a href="http://support.cs.toronto.edu/ApplicationServices/">CSLAB page</a> 
    for a list of CSLAB servers and applications you can run on them (eg matlab is only available on the
    computation servers). 
</p>
<p>
Several libraries are made available to you for this course.  
These libraries can be used for the assignments.  They are also 
used by the demos/tutorials that we provide to help illustrate
many of the concepts introduced throughout the course.  

<p>
The libraries and the tutorials are already installed on CSLAB machines. 
After logging onto a CSLAB or CDF machine, cd ~jepson/pub/matlab and read 
the README file.  
This file tells you how to set up matlab so that it will run the 
tutorials.  On CSLAB and CDF the tutorials are located in two directories: 
<ul>
<li>
/u/jepson/pub/matlab/iseToolbox/tutorials/  (referred to as ISE below),
<li>
/u/jepson/pub/matlab/utvisToolbox/tutorials/ (referred to as UTVIS below).
</ul>
We will indicate which toolbox to look in throughout the course when we 
refer to the different tutorials.

<H3>Running Matlab at Home</H3>

<p>The Matlab toolboxes we use in this course are also available for
download to your home computer (assuming you have Matlab at home) from the 
<a href="Handouts/matlabVisTools.zip">matlabVisTools.zip file (60MB)</a>.  
After unzipping this file, see the matlab/README file for instructions 
on how to set your matlab path.  A second zip file containing two image 
sequences is needed for the motion tutorial, namely 
<a href="Handouts/matlabVisToolsSeq.zip">matlabVisToolsSeq.zip file (75MB)</a>. 
Unpack this zip file in the same directory as the previous one.  It should form a new subdirectory matlab/images/seq/.<br><br>
